#While brainstorming for creation of user stories, we followed a structured approach. We first listed the features or elements that we could identify as part of the game. 
The game would consist of elements like:
1.	Character/ Story
1.1.	Aladdin modeling
1.2.	Animate Aladdin
1.3.	Magic Carpet modeling
1.4.	Animate Magic carpet
1.5.	Hurdles Modeling
1.6.	Animate Hurdles
1.7.	Genie Modeling
1.8.	Jasmine Modeling
2.	Controls
2.1.	Input Methods 
2.2.	Navigation
2.3.	Start and End Game
3.	Interface
3.1.	Input methods
3.2.	Multichannel 
3.3.	Loss of service / dysfunctional interface 
4.	Rules
4.1.	Level Design 
4.2.	Navigation Design
4.3.	Score collection Design
5.	Music
5.1.	Audio Design
6.	Display
6.1.	Background Design
6.2.	Character Design
6.3.	Start and End Screen design
6.4.	Instruction Screen Design
6.5.	Finalization of resolution and color scheme
Minimum requirements: 
1.	Duration of game is … min.
2.	The delivery date or release date is …….
3.	Minimum feature set- Single player- one kind of obstacles- find genie
On the basis of the above analysis we have created three epic stories

#Epic stories:
1.	As an actor (Aladdin) in the game, I want to have a maximum score so that I reach Jasmine.
2.	As a player in the game, I want to help the actor navigate so that Aladdin can move.
3.	As an obstacle in the game, I will prevent Aladdin to go further as I don’t want him to reach destination.
4.	As a developer of the game, I should be able to develop a game which is clear and understandable, so that the player can play the game well.

# User stories:
1.	As a player in the game, I want to know my score so that I know how close I am to my goal.
2.	As a player in the game, I want to be able to identify the hurdles correctly and avoid them.
3.	As a player in the game, I should hear music to understand whether I am still in the game.
4.	As a player in the game, I need to see Genie and Jasmine at the end of the game.
5.	As an actor in the game, I should be able to navigate through the obstacles.
6.	As a player in the game, I should understand the rules.
7.	As a hurdle in the game, I should be able to end the game as soon as the player lands on me.
8.	As an actor in the game, I should be able to move using an input interface.
9.	As a developer of the game, I should ensure the audio is designed.
