Week:1
Several practices embody courage. During development of our project, we will always tell the truth about progress and estimates of the project. We already have planned to succeed so we will not document any excuses for failure. We are in a team so we do not have any fear in our mind. We are ready to adopt changes as per the requirement of the project. We will put an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. 

Week:2
Courage will enable us to feel comfortable with a refactoring of our code whenever it is necessary. We have the courage to review the existing system and modify it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. We will show courage in knowing that when to throw code away like courage to remove source code that is obsolete. If we are stuck in any complex problems then we have the courage to overcome the problem by remaining patient. It may happen that we have not worked on certain technologies before but we have the courage to learn them and implement in our project as per needed.
