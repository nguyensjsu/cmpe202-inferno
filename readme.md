**Project Idea**
We are planning to build a game named "Aladdin". The theme of the game is as following,
In the city of Agra there lived Aladdin. Aladdin fell in love with Jasmine, the princess of Agra. Since he was a poor guy, Jafar, the Sultan of Agra was against their love. Hence Aladdin was thrown out of the city. In order to meet Jasmine he has to cross three hurdles. 
In the first hurdle Aladdin will have to face 2 enemies in order to obtain the magic carpet, with the carpet Aladdin can fly over the city.
Now with the help of magic carpet Aladdin can travel safely facing few obstacles to reach towards the magic flask. The magical character 'Genie' is trapped inside the magic flask. Aladdin ask Genie to help him to cross obstacles in his way.
In the third and the last level Aladdin and Genie will be facing 'Jafar'.If Aladdin can tackle him he will meet Jasmine.
