# Week 1

### What did the team do the past week?
A formal team meeting was setup with an objective to know each other and to discuss project ideas.
We discussed and tried to understand the requirements for the project with respect to game development. 
As per the discussion, to do list was defined. The "To do" list focused more on research and ideas that could be deployed effectively and efficiently. A follow up meeting was setup, a room was booked at MLK Library to brainstorm more on game ideas, we discussed plot related to Game of thrones, Mario and others. After discussing pros and cons of each idea, an unanimous decision was made to go ahead with Aladdin plot for the game development.

### What is the team going to do next week?
After finalizing the idea of Aladdin game, the team will focus on the technology in which we can implement our idea and the game engines like greenfoot, unity3d, melonjs etc that we would be using for game development. 
We will be focusing on the different stages that can be included in our game to make it interactive and complex as level increases. We will list down the tasks we need to implement in the whole project so that we will have an idea that what exactly is needed to be done. We will divide those tasks among team members so that it will be easy for everyone to complete on given time and for the betterment of our project. 

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
The current challenge team facing is on selecting the technology that suits best for the project. As the project is to develop game, we need to focus on graphics, multimedia and object interaction. The key focus is to decide and to incorporate Design Patterns that apply best to the project following principles of Agile Kanban and Scrum. The major challenge team would face during the Lifecycle of the project is time management as team would be busy doing more than one project. 
Team is focusing more to research on technologies which can make implementation easier. In addition to this, team has not yet finalized on how many levels will be there in the game and what will be the difficulty for each level.
Team would try to finalize the same in the upcoming meetings.


# Week-2
### What did the team do the past week?
In last week, we finalized with the technology and game engine. We will be using Java/JavaScript as a technology and Greenfoot as our game engine. The team installed the greenfoot IDE and other things required for a project. As the team was not having knowledge about greenfoot so the team has started to learn greenfoot. We made a lot of research on the structure of the game and came to a conclusion that there will be 3 levels in our game so that it will be more interactive and complex as level increases. The team has listed down the task needed to be done in upcoming weeks.

### What is the team going to do next week?
* We will be exploring functionalities related to Java and Greenfoot.
* Designing user stories around the project to have clarity on the development of functionality related to development of game. 
* Developing a small prototype for the game. 

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
* To explore all functionalities of Greenfoot that can be incorporated in our project.
* Design of User Story
* Study of patterns that will be included in our project

Week-3
### What did the team do the past week?
In last week, We started working on our idea like structuring the stages, level of difficulty of the game etc. We started learning our game engine i.e Greenfoot. So after learning basic things and functionality of greenfoot we started developing the basic prototype of the game link of which is given in README.md. Every team member has worked on the task assigned to them as per thr project need.  

### What is the team going to do next week?
* Modify User stories according to changes discussed.
* Creation of UML diagrams
* Decide on hurdle functionality of the game.

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
This week communication was biggest roadblock, since everyone was occupied with other project works. We have not been able to draft user stories around actor and game points. We are still trying to figure it out. Also designing UML diagrams will be a challenge.

Week-4
### What did the team do the past week?
As we decided to work on user stories and and the rough sketch of the levels of the game, we did exactly the same in last week. WE have created few user stories for game player.We have divided the UML diagrams amongst us. Futher we talked on the hurdle functionality of the game.
