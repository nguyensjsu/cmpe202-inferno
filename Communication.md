Week #1

Software is developed as quickly as possible when there is some sort of communication in projects. Everyone is part of the team and should communicate face to face. As a team, we had face to face communication couple of times this week. We created our group on Whatsapp, a messaging service and had interactions with each other on Whatsapp regarding the different game topics. We met and discussed the game topics and received everyone's feedback on all the topics. We discussed on which technologies we are going to base our project on and hence we decided Alladin game as our best choice. We will work together on everything from requirements to code.


Week #2 
* As the project idea is decided, it's time to find out the resources and technologies that will be required to  complete the project. 
* We discussed different technologies which are available and can be used to leverage our project and we decided to use Greenfoot.
* Greenfoot is a Java development environment which is used to build graphical applications.

Week #3
* We developed a prototype for our game, while doing so we faced some issues like how to make the background dynamic, hence we assigned different tasks to every member in the group.
* Each group member came up with different ideas and solution on how to change the background from static to dynamic.
* Hence by communicating and discussing we tackled the issues and challenges that we were facing.

Week #4
* As we were developing user stories we met and discussed on how and what can be our possibilities.
* We also discussed our experience at Silicon Valley Code Camp and what we learned from the sessions that we attended.
* As we have our midterm, we connected with each other through conference calls and then we discussed the progress of the project. 


Week #5
* We met and discussed about the design patterns.
* We figured out which all design patterns suits our project well so that we can incorporate them in our project to leverage the game.
