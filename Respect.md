Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. Without respect any project can never be successful.
 
The project discussion started with choosing a topic, diverse ideas from each of the team members had come. Each team member patiently listened and analyze the idea investing their own time instead of just denying the idea.
Team combined all ideas those were discussed during our meeting, each member studied feasibility of project and then it was discussed in the next meeting and with the agreement of each team member one idea was finalized for the project.
