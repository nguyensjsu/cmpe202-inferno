Implementing the game is an unexplored territory for the team. After exploring the ambitious ideas, we did a feasibility check of time and resources and finalized to make the Aladdin Game. The game has to have three levels of the game, which is the long-term plan. Currently, we have explored and decided to go ahead with making the first level of the game, so that we have a working prototype at the earliest with us. Next, depending on the bandwidth of resources, we will go ahead with adding features and levels for the game.
